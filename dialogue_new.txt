Underling: Urgent news from the gates.
Arch Lich: Speak.
Underling: The latest groups of adventurers - they're upon us. 
Underling: These are stronger than ever before, I'm afraid. 
Underling: They're already through the outer gates and they're about to-
Arch Lich: Hush, young one... I find your lack of Faith disturbing. 
Underling: My apologies.  
Arch Lich: Come, we will show them the error of their ways.

Luxon: *huff huff* are we there yet?
Cid: No. Shut up, and keep walking. 
[Shana, Cid]
Shana: Aw Cid, don't be such an old grouch. 
Cid: I'm younger than you. Why did we have to bring him along, anyway? 
Cid: He doesn't even have any fighting skills!
[Luxon, Cid]
Luxon: Do too! I can... uh...
[Shana, Cid]
Shana: He can dazzle stuff. I seen it with my own eyes. 
Cid: Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn. If he's useless, 
Cid: we're ditching him. Like we'd agreed upon.
Shana: I know, I know. Luxon, you better step it up. 
[Luxon, Cid]
Luxon: :'( Fine. You'll see. You'll both see!
Cid: Let's just get moving.

Landlord: Ah! There you are. I've been waiting all day for you. 
Landlord: Gosh, I've never done this quest giving thing before. 
Landlord: But aren't you guys a little... puny for heroes?
Cid: ...
Landlord: HAHA WELL never mind, I suppose you can give it a try. 
Landlord: If you fail though, I'm not liable. 
Landlord: In fact, why don't you sign this form over here. 
Cid: ...
Landlord: Or... not. Well anyway, you've heard of the reign of the
Landlord: evil Arch Lich, terrorizing the kingdoms, et cetera. 
Cid: Yes. I wasn't aware the Lich's domain has extended this far.
Landlord: Well it has. And you'd better do something about it!
[Luxon, Landlord]
Luxon: Just tell us what needs doing, and we'll do it. 
Landlord: I need you to eliminate all the pesky necromancers
Landlord: with their fancy minions and skeletons. And reclaim my lands 
Landlord: from rebellious peasants who have turned to the dark side. 
[Cid, Landlord]
Cid: Oh of course. Blame the peasants. 
Landlord: Naturally. Glad you understand. Well, chop chop. 
Landlord: My land isn't going to reclaim itself.

Luxon: Aha! A evil necromancer!
[Shana, Necro]
Shana: Surrender now, or prepare to fight!
Peasant: !
Luxon: Hands in the air! I said-
[Luxon, Blank]
Luxon: Aw... he ran away. 
[Luxon, Cid]
Cid: Probably because you scared him, you idiot. 
Cid: But at least we got rid of all his minions. We'd best report back.
Luxon: Yeah. Maybe we'll get some sweet loot! 
Luxon: Perhaps I'll even be able to claim a maiden's -
Cid: No. 
Luxon: :( I was going to say hand in marriage... 
_house_
*bgm_dia_happy* 
[Cid, Landlord]
Cid: Well, we're back. We managed to take care of the minions
Cid: and skeletons plaguing your fields.
Landlord: Good good good. And what of the necromancers?
Cid: Well...
[Shana, Landlord]
Shana: Luxon scared them away. 
Luxon: Hey!
[Luxon, Landlord]
Landlord: Hrm. Well, no matter. Presumably they wouldn't dare come back. You did well, young heroes. 
Luxon: So uh...
Landlord: Yes?
Luxon: Do we get a reward or something...?
Landlord: Eh... well... you know, with all the skeletons terrorizing the land... 
Landlord: There's been few taxes to collect, you see, and, well...
[Shana, Landlord]
Shana: Is that a no?!
[Luxon, Landlord] 
Luxon: Don't you know who I am?!
Landlord: Actually, no...
Luxon: The name's Starlord. Luxon Starlord. 
[Shana, Landlord]
Shana: ...
[Cid, Landlord]
Cid: ...
Landlord: ... 
Cid: That's definitely not even your real name.
[Cid, Luxon]
Luxon: It is too you hater!
Cid: ... I have no idea what a 'hater' is, but let's not discuss that now. 
Cid: Sir Landlord, we have provided you with great service, 
Cid: and we expect to be compensated for our time. 
[Cid, Landlord]
Landlord: Fine. Have some of this. (sprite w/ something derp looking) 
Cid: What's that? Looks like Monopoly money... 
Landlord: The stuff that dreams are made of. 
Landlord: Don't you uncultured peasants know anything?
Cid: We only take payment in gold. VISA If you really must.
Landlord: Fine. (He hands the party 3 gold, one for each of you.)
Cid: That's it? 
Landlord: Yup! But if you talk to my cousin in the next town over, 
Landlord: I'm sure he'll be happy to give you something on my behalf. 
Landlord: Here, let me give you a letter to him. 
Landlord: (Received Letter to Landlord's Rich Merchant Cousin)
Cid: Fine. That'll do. 
[Cid, Luxon]
Luxon: How far is it? I can't walk any further today.
Cid: Can't? Or won't?
Luxon: A little of column A, a little of column B. 
Cid: Let's get going. 
[Cid, Shana]
Shana: I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship. 
Cid: Over my dead body it is.

[Shana, Cid]
Cid:  hey where Luxon go? 
Shana: I don't know I thought you were keeping an eye on him
Cid: Let's go find him before he gets us all into trouble again
[Luxon, Stella]
Stella: So I hear you helped recover some fields today 
Stella: over by the village with the evil necromancers.
Luxon: How do you know about that?
Stella: Word travels fast. 
Luxon: Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute. You ain't heard nothin' yet!
Stella: Oh?
Luxon: I gotta tell you about how we destroyed them! 
Luxon: They ran away screaming from us like cowards
Stella: Surely you can't be serious.
Luxon: I am serious...and don't call me Shirley.
Stella: ...Right... But you didn't kill them, right?
Luxon: Doesn't matter. No way they'll go back to doing evil things now.
Stella: Got it. It sure was brave of you.
Luxon: I know! Well, nobody's perfect, but I-
Stella: Hey aren't those your friends over there?
[Luxon, Blank]
Luxon: Where? ... Huh? Where'd she go?
[Shana, Luxon]
Shana: Geez Luxon, we've been looking all over for you.
[Cid, Luxon]
Cid: I told her to leave you to your own devices, but she insisted.
Luxon: Thanks guys, but I was actually with this girl...
Luxon: And I think you guys might've just scared her away.
Cid: WE scared her away? Ugh, I'm going back to the inn. 
[Shana, Luxon]
Shana: I'm sure she just... needed to powder her nose. 
Luxon: Yeah, that seems likely.Well, it's been a long day. Let's turn in for the night.
Shana: Yeah, let's head back.
_day_
*bg_dia*
[Shana, Cid]
Shana: *Yawn* Guess we ought to head out.
Cid: Yeah. Our reward isn't going to collect itself.

[Cid, Merchant]
Cid: Hello, we've come to collect a reward. 
Merchant: Hm? Who sent you here? What reward?
Cid: Your cousin, the Landlord?
Merchant: The... Landlord? 
Cid: Here, I have a letter from him.
Merchant: Ah. ... Well, if it isn't my least favourite cousin. 
Cid: Just my luck. You going to give us anything or not?
Merchant: No way! That man owes me so much money... But you know, I could give you something if you're also willing to do some work for me. 
Cid: I guess we're not doing anything else. You guys cool with that?
[Shana, Merchant]
Shana: Yep.
[Luxon, Merchant]
Luxon: Do we get to fight more bad guys?
Merchant: Why yes. Some no-good Lich-worshippers recently stole something of mine. And I want it back! 
[Cid, Merchant]
Cid: Really. What did they steal?
Merchant: Everything they have on them, probably!I want all of it!
Cid: Could you, perhaps, be a teeny bit more specific?
Merchant: Don't test me, young man. A census taker once tried to test me. 
Cid: What?
Merchant: Do as I say, and you can have all the riches you desire.
Cid: I really don't think-
[Luxon, Merchant]
Luxon: Mr. Merchant, we accept your quest.
[Cid, Luxon]
Cid: Luxon, what if-
Luxon: Cid, with all due respect, Greed, for lack of a better word, is good.
[Cid, Shana]
Shana: I'm with Luxon on this one. I need me some new armour. 
Cid: It appears I've been outvoted. Well, off we go then. 
[Cid, Luxon]
Luxon: Yaaay!
Cid: We can still ditch you, you know.

Arch Lich: I sense a great disturbance in the Faith
Arch Lich: As if a million undead suddenly turned over in their figurative graves
Stella: Yes Sir, I know. I'll take care of it. 
Stella: I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.
Arch Lich: Do not disappoint me. May the Faith be with you. 
[Blank, NoxNecro]
Arch Lich: I have a bad feeling about this...

[Luxon, Stella]
Luxon: Stella! What are you doing here?
Stella: I'm so glad I caught up to you guys. 
Stella: I wanted to warn you of the danger ahead.
Luxon: We know, that's why we're going. Stand aside so we can save the kingdom!
Stella: I'm warning you, it's not something you want to go up against.
Shana: We already killed a horde of undead, how bad can it be?
Luxon: Yeah! 
Stella: Look, I just, you can't go, okay? Besides, 
Stella: Luxon, wouldn't you rather stay in the town and hang out with me ;) ?
Cid: How did you vocalize that winky face?!
Luxon: Stella, I appreciate the offer, but we really-
Stella: Luxon, I just have to tell you - I love you.
Luxon: What? Really?
Stella: Yes! Now please stay here and have my babies. 
Luxon: Wow! Today, I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the Earth.
Cid: You can do that later.
Luxon: B-but-
Stella: I want to do it now!
Shana: Come on, Luxon, we have to get going. 
Shana: You can't ditch us after all we've been through together. 
Luxon: Sorry Stella, duty calls. I'll be back!
Stella: Wait-

[Luxon, Cid]
Luxon: Phewf. That went well.
Cid: No thanks to you.
Shana: Hey, knock that off. Luxon did his part. 
Cid: Whatever, let's just collect what we came here for.
Luxon: Hey, what's this? ... Whoa, there's so much stuff here?
Cid: How much can we carry? Does the merchant want everything?!
Luxon: Let's just take the most expensive stuff. 
Cid: Good thing one of us came prepared. 
Cid: Let's just stuff it all in my conveniently large inventory. 
Luxon: Compensating for something?
Shana: You too, Luxon. A man's manhood is no laughing matter!
Cid: ... Whatever, just get to work so we can leave.

[Stella, Necro]
Stella: I thought I told you to run. What happened?
Necro: We had... we had to defend our homes! 
Stella: I also recall telling you living in the forest 
Stella: was not a great idea. Well, what's done is done. 
Stella: At least I arrived in time to save you.
Necro: Thank you, milady. 
Stella: Just keep an eye out in the future, alright? 
Stella: You all lucked out this time, but next time...
Necro: We will. 
Stella: And move out of the damned forest.
Stella: Until you learn to fight, stay away from others, alright?
Necro: Yes milady.

[Shana, Cid]
Shana: Glad we made it back alright.
Cid: Yeah. Hey, where's the merchant?
[Cid, King]
King: Oh, thank goodness, you found my foolish son.
Cid: T-the king! Your Majesty. m(___)m ...Wait. Son?
[Luxon, King]
Luxon: Daaad! You're embarrassing me again!
King: Well. Maybe I wouldn't have to be here if you'd simply 
King: do as you're told, like your siblings. Your friends, 
King: however... seem to be useful people.
Shana: Who, us?
King: I have heard tales of your bravery in battling the undead. 
King: As you know, the undead have been plaguing the kingdom for years, 
King: but only now have they become bold enough to be a nuisance.
Cid: I see.
King: I would appreciate it if you were able to end this plague 
King: once and for all. And if you don't mind, take my useless son with you.
[Cid, King]
Cid: I mind. A little.
[Shana, King]
Shana: Of course, your majesty. 
[Luxon, King]
Luxon: Yaaay! 
King: They seem to be most concentrated in the hills to the east. 
King: I've heard rumors that their deity, the Arch Lich, was also 
King: last seen in that area, though it's been a long time since 
King: that name has been mentioned. Do not disappoint me.
[Cid, Blank]
Cid: Wait, we never got paid >:( Show me the money!
[Cid, Shana]
Shana: We don't need no payment; we're heroes!
Cid: Let's see you try to buy food with 'hero cred'.
[Cid, Luxon]
Luxon: It's ok, you might as well know that my monthly allowance
Luxon: Is in excess of the cost of one party hat. 
Cid: You can buy party hats with your monthly allowance?! What the actual f-
[Cid, Shana]
Shana: I suppose that's only expected for a prince. 
Luxon: Yeah guys, don't worry about that. 
Luxon: I'm sure my father will also reward you handsomely.
Cid: He better. We'd best get moving. Wouldn't want 
Cid: to keep His Majesty waiting, after all.
Shana: As God is my witness, I'll never be hungry again!

Stella: Not sure if my disguise was that good or you are just that dumb. But yes, it is I. 
[Cid, Stella]
Cid: Your interest in Luxon suddenly makes a lot more sense.
Stella: Yes... well... I'm sorry I deceived you, but... 
Stella: You don't know what you're doing. Please, just leave us alone!
Cid: And why should we?
[Luxon, Stella]
Luxon: Yeah! My dad says you're terrorists!
Stella: Terrorists?!

Luxon: Eep! It's the Arch Lich! 
[Cid, NoxNecro]
Cid: Stay alert!
Arch Lich: I was kidding. I already sent everyone away. 
Arch Lich: I will face you alone.
Cid: Your reign of terror ends mere?
Arch Lich: MY reign of terror? How... interesting. 
Cid: What else would you call it? 
Arch Lich: I'd tell you, but you wouldn't believe me.
Cid: Try me.
[Luxon, NoxNecro]
Luxon: Enough talking! 
[Cid, NoxNecro]
Cid: But I wanted to hear her evil monologue :(
Arch Lich: As I wanted to give it. But alas, it seems we must move on.

Cid: I'm not sure...
[Cid, Nox]
Nox: Surprised? Ha! Looks like I'm a lot weaker than I thought. 
[Luxon, Nox]
Luxon: Oh my gosh, a hot babe! 
Nox: ...
[Cid, Nox]
Cid: ...What's going on? What is the meaning of this?
Nox: I'm afraid your trip was a waste. 
Nox: I was nearing the end of my life even before your untimely appearance. 
Nox: You merely hastened it. I expect I have, oh, about a minute or two left. 
Nox: I'm hanging on by a thread through sheer force of will. 
Cid: Why fight us anyway? I don't understand!
Nox: I had hoped that, were you as strong as I feared, 
Nox: you would be open to reason. 
[Luxon, Nox]
Luxon: I said this before to Stella, and I'll say it again now
Luxon: We do NOT negotiate-
[Cid, Nox]
Cid: Shut up!
[Shana, Nox]
Shana: Luxon, for once in your life!
[Cid, Nox]
Nox: How Amusing. Before the next world takes me, 
Nox: I would like to tell you a little story.
Nox: Back in my day, when I was an adventurer like you, 
Nox: I discovered the power over the dead, and taught it to 
Nox: the poorest, the neediest, who became self-sustaining with 
Nox: an army of workers that needed neither food nor sleep.
Nox: Of course, the lords and ladies did not like that. 
Nox: We were vilified, chased out into the deepest corners of the realm, 
Nox: where we practiced in secret, undisturbed for decades, 
Nox: until your king sought to expand his territory. 
Nox: I taught my students, now spanning many generations, 
Nox: to fight for their families and land. But of course this 
Nox: did no favours for our image as "bloody evil necromancers".
Nox: The stories about us grew more outrageous. I became a 
Nox: frequent target of would-be heroes who would come to 
Nox: this very castle to challenge me. 
Nox: Some I managed to convince to join our cause. 
Nox: Others, I admit, joined our cause against their will. As undead. 
Nox: Many good men and women have died at the hands of so-called 
Nox: heroes like you. It is too late for me to stop you, 
Nox: but I would implore that you reconsider, before hunting down my brethren. 
Cid: What you have said... 
Cid: Given what I know of the king, it doesn't surprise me.
[Luxon, Nox]
Luxon: I can't believe my father would do that!
Nox: If you choose to join our cause, 
Nox: I will give you my knowledge. 
Nox: If not, I ask only that you spare the innocent
Nox: What will you choose?
