[Shana, Blank]
Shana: What... just happened?
[Luxon, Blank]
Luxon: Did... did the Arch Lich die?
[Cid, Blank]
Cid: I'm not sure...
[Cid, Nox]
Nox: Surprised? Ha! Looks like I'm a lot weaker than I thought. 
[Luxon, Nox]
Luxon: Oh my gosh, a hot babe! 
Nox: ...
[Cid, Nox]
Cid: ...What's going on? What is the meaning of this?
Nox: I'm afraid your trip was a waste. 
Nox: I was nearing the end of my life even before your untimely appearance. 
Nox: You merely hastened it. I expect I have, oh, about a minute or two left. 
Nox: I'm hanging on by a thread through sheer force of will. 
Cid: Why fight us anyway? I don't understand!
Nox: I had hoped that, were you as strong as I feared, 
Nox: you would be open to reason. 
[Luxon, Nox]
Luxon: I said this before to Stella, and I'll say it again now
Luxon: We do NOT negotiate-
[Cid, Nox]
Cid: Shut up!
[Shana, Nox]
Shana: Luxon, for once in your life!
[Cid, Nox]
Nox: How Amusing. Before the next world takes me, 
Nox: I would like to tell you a little story.
Nox: Back in my day, when I was an adventurer like you, 
Nox: I discovered the power over the dead, and taught it to 
Nox: the poorest, the neediest, who became self-sustaining with 
Nox: an army of workers that needed neither food nor sleep.
Nox: Of course, the lords and ladies did not like that. 
Nox: We were vilified, chased out into the deepest corners of the realm, 
Nox: where we practiced in secret, undisturbed for decades, 
Nox: until your king sought to expand his territory. 
Nox: I taught my students, now spanning many generations, 
Nox: to fight for their families and land. But of course this 
Nox: did no favours for our image as ""bloody evil necromancers"".
Nox: The stories about us grew more outrageous. I became a 
Nox: frequent target of would-be heroes who would come to 
Nox: this very castle to challenge me. 
Nox: Some I managed to convince to join our cause. 
Nox: Others, I admit, joined our cause against their will. As undead. 
Nox: Many good men and women have died at the hands of so-called 
Nox: heroes like you. It is too late for me to stop you, 
Nox: but I would implore that you reconsider, before hunting down my brethren. 
Cid: What you have said... 
Cid: Given what I know of the king, it doesn't surprise me.
[Luxon, Nox]
Luxon: I can't believe my father would do that!
Nox: If you choose to join our cause, 
Nox: I will give you my knowledge. 
Nox: If not, I ask only that you spare the innocent
Nox: What will you choose?
