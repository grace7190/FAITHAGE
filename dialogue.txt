[Cid, Blank]
Cid: This castle has suspiciously empty. What if it's a trap?
[Cid, NoxNecro]
Arch Lich: Well. At least one of you has some brains. 
[Luxon, NoxNecro]
Luxon: Eep! It's the Arch Lich! 
[Cid, NoxNecro]
Cid: Stay alert!
Arch Lich: I was kidding. I already sent everyone away. I will face you alone.
Cid: Your reign of terror ends mere?
Arch Lich: MY reign of terror? How... interesting. 
Cid: What else would you call it? 
Arch Lich: I'd tell you, but you wouldn't believe me.
Cid: Try me.
[Luxon, NoxNecro]
Luxon: Enough talking! 
[Cid, NoxNecro]
Cid: But I wanted to hear her evil monologue :(
Arch Lich: As I wanted to give it. But alas, it seems we must move on.Surrender now, or prepare to fight!
